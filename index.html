    <p> Working in BPO for 5 years. I started in Sitel- Ortigas as Customer Service for
        Billing. My performance was lackluster as it was my first job.
        It resulted in termination of my employment. Next company was Alorica- Makati as a Technical Support. I worked
        for about a year and decided to resign due to company's relocation.
        I then applied with my previous co-worker and we luckily landed in the same company and account in OAMPI-
        Makati. I stayed in the company for two years.
        <br><br>
        Then the pandemic hit. Life is hard and I made the hardest decision- to resign for, for my safety and everyone
        else around me. I've been out of work during pandemic for several months.
